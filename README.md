# Speech Emotion Recognition ðŸŽ¤ðŸŽ­

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for **Speech Emotion Recognition**, which involves analyzing and classifying emotions from speech signals. The project utilizes machine learning techniques and audio processing to identify emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, and neutrality from speech data.

## ðŸ“œ Project Overview
- **Goal**: To build a model that can classify emotions from speech recordings.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Jupyter Notebook, Librosa, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/PyTorch.
- **Dataset**: Uses publicly available datasets such as RAVDESS, TESS, or Emo-DB.
